A suite of Ajax search widgets to interface with the Discovery Engine.

The simplicity widgets provide a set of jQuery UI JavaScript widgets
that enable a highly-responsive Ajax based search interface.
They are comprised of UI widgets and a server-sides search controller,

The search controller uses a RESTful API with regular URL parameters for
the request and expect a JSON response.

To see the widgets in action open `index.html` in your favorite browser
or [view online](http://t11e.github.com/simplicity).

To build a minified version of the widgets, run:

    mvn clean package
